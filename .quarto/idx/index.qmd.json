My contribution is converting Kruschke’s JAGS and Stan code for use in another probabilistic programming framework,`Turing.jl`, which makes it easier to fit Bayesian regression models in Julia (@ge2018t) using a number of samplers. I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from `Plots.jl`(@bezanson2017julia). So we’ll be using those methods, too.\n\nThis ebook is not meant to stand alone. It’s a supplement to the second edition of @kruschke2015doing Doing Bayesian data analysis: A tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan. Please give the source material some love.\n\n## Julia setup\n\nTo follow along with this guide, you’ll need some software. Download and install Julia by following the instructions at [https://julialang.org/downloads/.](https://julialang.org/downloads/) The [Getting Started page](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/) has in depth instructions that can help.\n\nYou will also need to install some packages. To install packages in Julia, you will need the `Pkg` package. Fortunately the Julia REPL (which stands for \"read, execute, print, loop\") has a trick that allows you to access the package from within the REPL command-line. Enter the Pkg REPL by pressing ] from the Julia REPL. To get back to the Julia REPL, press backspace. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\nFor more information on the Pkg REPL, take a look at the Julia documentation, which is available here: [https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/.](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/)\n:::\n\n\n## Version 0.0.1.\n\nI am just starting this project. I plan to have a complete draft including material from all the chapters in Kruschke’s text by January 2023"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo","cover-image":"DBDA2Ecover.png"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
