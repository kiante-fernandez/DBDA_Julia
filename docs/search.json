    "section": "",
    "text": "Kruschke began his text with, “This book explains how to actually do Bayesian data analysis, by real people (like you), for realistic data (like yours).” In the same way, this project is designed to help those real people do Bayesian data analysis. My contribution is converting Kruschke’s JAGS and Stan code for use in another probabilistic programming framework,Turing.jl, which makes it easier to fit Bayesian regression models in Julia (Ge, Xu, and Ghahramani (2018)) using a number of samplers. I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from Plots.jl(Bezanson et al. (2017)). So we’ll be using those methods, too.\nThis ebook is not meant to stand alone. It’s a supplement to the second edition of Kruschke (2015) Doing Bayesian data analysis: A tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan. Please give the source material some love.\n\n\nTo follow along with this guide, you’ll need some software. Download and install Julia by following the instructions at https://julialang.org/downloads/. The Getting Started page has in depth instructions that can help.\nYou will also need to install some packages. To install packages in Julia, you will need the Pkg package. Fortunately the Julia REPL (which stands for “read, execute, print, loop”) has a trick that allows you to access the package from within the REPL command-line. Enter the Pkg REPL by pressing ] from the Julia REPL. To get back to the Julia REPL, press backspace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor more information on the Pkg REPL, take a look at the Julia documentation, which is available here: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am just starting this project. I plan to have a complete draft including material from all the chapters in Kruschke’s text by January 2023\n\n\n\n\nBezanson, Jeff, Alan Edelman, Stefan Karpinski, and Viral B Shah. 2017. “Julia: A Fresh Approach to Numerical Computing.” SIAM Review 59 (1): 65–98. https://doi.org/10.1137/141000671.\n\n\nGe, Hong, Kai Xu, and Zoubin Ghahramani. 2018. “Turing: A Language for Flexible Probabilistic Inference.” In International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, AISTATS 2018, 9-11 April 2018, Playa Blanca, Lanzarote, Canary Islands, Spain, 1682–90. http://proceedings.mlr.press/v84/ge18b.html.\n\n\nKruschke, John. 2015.

    "text": "I am not a statistician and have no formal computer science background. I am in the process of learning the Julia programming language (part of the goal of this project!). I am currently a Ph.D. student in psychology. I have been mostly an R and MATLAB user and started learning Bayesian statistics around 2019. My code will likely be “bad” as I get the hang of things. I have much to learn from the Julia community and thus encourage folk to reach out with suggestions on how to improve my code. If you’d like to learn more about me, you can find my website at https://www.kiantefernandez.com/."

plot will involve getting creating some Gaussian distributions. To do so, we will use the Distributions.jl package. Distribution allows create and extract information from a wide range of probability distributions. We will use this package a lot in subsequent chapter to draw samples to facilitate Bayesian inference. Note that I am ignoring the scaling issue apparent from the four distributions densities not being equal to one. Also to create the illusion of a discrete x axis, I will just show only the 4 values.\nTODO: rescale the curves such that the density on the y axis for each curve sums to one.\n\nusing Gadfly\nusing

    "text": "2.3 The steps of Bayesian data analysis\n\nIn general, Bayesian analysis of data follows these steps:\n\nIdentify the data relevant to the research questions. What are the measurement scales of the data? Which data variables are to be predicted, and which data variables are supposed to act as predictors?\nDefine a descriptive model for the relevant data. The mathematical form and its parameters should be meaningful and appropriate to the theoretical purposes of the analysis.\nSpecify a prior distribution on the parameters. The prior must pass muster with the audience of the analysis, such as skeptical scientists.\nUse Bayesian inference to re-allocate credibility across parameter values. Interpret the posterior distribution with respect to theoretically meaningful issues (assuming that the model is a reasonable description of the data; see next step).\nCheck that the posterior predictions mimic the data with reasonable accuracy (i.e., conduct a “posterior predictive check”). If not, then consider a different descriptive model.\n\nPerhaps the best way to explain these steps is with a realistic example of Bayesian data analysis. The discussion that follows is abbreviated for purposes of this introductory chapter, with many technical details suppressed. (p. 25)\n\nI will showcase the entire workflow here. In later chapters we’ll cover this workflow in much more detail.\nFirst we need to generate the data and fit a model to those data. In HtWtDataDenerator.R script, Kruschke provided the code for a function that will simulate height/weight data. Lets rewrite that function in Julia:\n\nusing Distributions, Random, DataFrames, StatsBase\n\nfunction HtWtDataGenerator(nSubj, rndsd = nothing, maleProb = 0.50) \n    # Random height, weight generator for males and females.

The nSubj argument determines how many values to generate, and maleProb determines how probable we want those values to be from men.\n\n\n\n5 rows × 3 columnsmaleheightweightFloat64Float64Float6411.066.0141.220.060.4104.330.062.7139.440.061.7109.951.064.4162.5\n\n\nWe’re about ready for the model, which we will fit it with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method via the turing.jl package.
